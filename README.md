## Problem

Plastic waste is a growing problem in our environment as it's not easily degradable and I've frequently encountered discarded plastic waste littering roads and public places. Proper plastic recycling solutions are limited, and a lot of times they end up in landfills or oceans.

## Solution

This printer is hoped to be a sustainable and innovative solution designed to tackle this problem by using plastic waste as a 3D printing material.
